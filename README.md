we have used eclipse software to create c++ file and ran it. 
To run the program, open all(4) files under same project.
Simpley build the project and 
Hit the run icon in eclipse. 

To run the program with custom parameters:

(1) Change the row and col variables in header.h to reflect the size of the array(s) you want to test.

(2a) To test the AlgorithmCalculate function, change ex1Events in main.cpp to have the string values you would like to use.

(2b) To test the AlgorithmVerify function, change ex1Clock, ex2Clock, and/or ex3Clock to have the int values you would like to use.

(3) Ensure that the row and col values are accurate for the new array you are testing, and comment out any array/function you are not testing. If you wish to test multiple arrays with different sizes, please do so in seperate program runs.
